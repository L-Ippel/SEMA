Description: The SEMA algorithm fits multilevel models in the context of 
    streaming data (a.k.a. data streams). Using online learning, the model is 
    updated a data point at the time. SEMA algorithm only stores summarizing 
    statistics, which limits memory usage, and because it never returns to the 
    data, sema algorithm is computationally efficient. The current state of the
    algorithm is able to fit multilevel models with fixed and random effects.
